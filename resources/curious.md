19100

### **Explain the significance of “dead beef”?**

Usually, people respond this question with an answer like “Beef is always dead” – Wrong Answer.  The correct answer is that “DEADBEEF” is a hexa-decimal value that was used in debugging back in the mainframe/assembly days as such it was easy to see when marking and finding specific memory in pages of hex dumps. Most computer engineers are aware of this term.

### **Mention what is the weight of the empire state building?**

This question was actually asked by google employers to check the thought process of the employee. It is to see how well employees can do “guestimate” that is what is referred for such question. It is a little tricky but if you good at numbers and height width calculation, you will surely come up with some answer. Anyway the answer to this question was something 750,000 tons or 1.5 billion pound of weight, after considering all the parameters like single floor widthXheight, weight, etc.

### **How much should you charge to wash all the windows in Seattle?**

If Seattle consists of 10,000 city blocks with 600 windows per block, and the window washer spends five minutes per window while being paid a rate of $20 per hour, the answer would be approximately $10 million. On the other hand, the ability to keep things simple can sometimes be just as valuable as on-the-fly math skills. In that case, an answer like "$10 per window" (and you’d get paid 6 times as much!) would also suffice.&#x20;
