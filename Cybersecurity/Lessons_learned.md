- The technical interviewer had read my Medium posts, so keep adding them
- Sometimes he asked short technical questions that could be answered with a short answer, but he seemed more satisfied when I gave examples about how I would do what he asked, or about related things that I have done.
- Even if he doesn't ask me something directly but can be related to something that I did, say it to fill some minutes and give him more context.
- When he asks something that I have only done in personal projects, instead say that I did it on a project at work.
