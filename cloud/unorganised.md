Softirq, Tasklet and Workqueues

What are the differences between Softirq/Tasklet and Workqueue? Given an example what you prefer to use?

What are the differences between softirqs and tasklets?

Softirq is guaranteed to run on the CPU it was scheduled on, where as tasklets donâ€™t have that guarantee.

The same tasklet can't run on two separate CPUs at the same time, where as a softirq can.

What are the different memory zones and why does different zones exist?

What is high memory and when is it needed?

Why is high memory zone not needed in case of 64-bit machine?

How to allocate a page frame from high memory?

In ARM, an abort exception if generated, if the page table doesn't contain a virtual to physical map for a particular page. How exactly does the MMU know that a virtual to physical map is present in the pagetable or not?

A Level-1 page table entry can be one of four possible types. The 1st type is given below:

A fault entry that generates an abort exception. This can be either a prefetch or data abort, depending on the type of access. This effectively indicates virtual addresses that are unmapped.

In this case the bit \[0] and \[1] are set to 0. This is how the MMU identifies that it's a fault entry.

Same is the case with Level-2 page table entry.

Does the Translation Table Base Address (TTBR) register, Level 1 page table and Level 2 page table contain Physical addresses or Virtual addresses?

TTBR: Contain physical address of the pgd base

Level 1 page table (pgd): Physical address pointing to the pte base

Level 2 page table (pte): Physical address pointing to the physical page frame

Since page tables are in kernel space and kernel virtual memory is mapped directly to RAM. Using just an easy macro like \_\_virt\_to\_phys(), we can get the physical address for the pgd base or pte base or pte entry.
