# Project Management

### As a manager, how do you handle trade-offs?

The most common set of tradeoffs in project management is the classic "time, quality, scope" triangle. You can do something faster, but in order to do so you must sacrifice either quality or scope; you can do something bigger, but in order to do so you must sacrifice either quality or time; and you can do something high in quality, but in order to do so you must sacrifice either scope or time.

Ask What as the limiting factors. Is it time, equipment, staff, money or all? Also ask What stage the project is in? and What are the key factors for success? Then go from there.

Go for an Agile development methodology (e.g. SCRUM) so that the project can focus on the most critical requirements and deliver them in chunks (Releases) that can be implemented to Production.

Knowing the deadline, work backwards to identify the components' completion date and identify the critical resource needs. Motivate the limited resources to double the efforts, use other means to improve productivity i.e. use of technology, bring in expert to optimise learning curve or just ways to complete activities in parallel. If there is still risk of delay, ask for temporary additional resources or communicate with the end user to extend the timeline.
