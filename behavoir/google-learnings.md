# Google Learnings

### Founder

Building an exceptional team or institution starts with a founder. But being a founder doesn’t mean “starting a new company. It is within anyone’s grasp to be the founder and culture-creator of their own team, whether you are the first employee or joining a company that has existed for decades.”

### Leader

“In Larry’s words: “I think about how far we’ve come as companies from those days, where workers had to protect themselves from the company. My job as a leader is to make sure everybody in the company has great opportunities, and that they feel they’re having a meaningful impact and are contributing to the good of society. As a world, we’re doing a better job of that. My goal is for Google to lead, not follow.”

### Freedom

“If you give people freedom, they will amaze you”

### Mission

Understanding mission company: “Google’s mission is the first cornerstone of our culture. Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. The most talented people on the planet want an aspiration that is also inspiring. Having workers meet the people they are helping is the greatest motivator, even if they only meet for a few minutes.

### Default to Open

If you believe people are good, you must be unafraid to share information with them. Default to open is a phrase sometimes heard in the open-source technology community. At Google, a newly hired software engineer gets access to almost all of our code on the first day. One of the serendipitous benefits of transparency is that simply by sharing data, performance improves.”

### Dogfooding

We also use an unfortunately named technique common in technology firms called “dogfooding,” where Googlers are the first to try new products and provide feedback.

Think of your work as a calling, with a mission that matters. Give people slightly more trust, freedom, and authority than you are comfortable giving them. If you’re not nervous, you haven’t given them enough.

Our CFO, Patrick Pichette, put the power in Googlers’ hands. He launched Bureaucracy Busters, a now-annual program where Googlers identify their biggest frustrations and help fix them.

### Training

Some experts go so far as to say that 90 percent of training doesn’t cause a sustained improvement in performance or change in behavior because it’s neither well designed nor well delivered.

A top-notch engineer is worth three hundred times or more than an average engineer.… I’d rather lose an entire incoming class of engineering graduates than one exceptional technologist.

### Exceptional

How can you tell if you have found someone exceptional? My simple rule of thumb—and the second big change to make in how you hire—is: “Only hire people who are better than you.

### Recruiting First

Given limited resources, invest your HR dollars first in recruiting. Hire only the best by taking your time, hiring only people who are better than you in some meaningful way, and not letting managers make hiring decisions for their own teams.

You have a couple of options. You can take your pile of cash and hire the best players on the planet to play for you. Or you could take the Bad News Bears approach: Assemble a ragtag team of misfits and by dint of your coaching, hard work, and deep insight into the motivation and human nature, mold them into a team of winners.

Get the best referrals by being excruciatingly specific in describing what you’re looking for. Make recruiting part of everyone’s job. Don’t be afraid to try crazy things to get the attention of the best people.

### Dont trust your gut

The best predictor of how someone will perform in a job is a work sample test.

To help interviewers, we’ve developed an internal tool called qDroid, where an interviewer picks the job they are screening for, checks the attributes they want to test, and is emailed an interview guide with questions designed to predict performance for that job. This makes it easy for interviewers to find and ask great interview questions. Interviewers can also share the document with others on the interview panel so everyone can collaborate to assess the candidate from all perspectives.

“Every company wants leaders. But Google looks for a particular type of leadership, called “emergent leadership.” This is a form of leadership that ignores formal designations—at Google there is rarely a formal leader of any effort.”

“Googleyness.” We want people who will thrive at Google. This isn’t a neatly defined box, but includes attributes like enjoying fun (who doesn’t?), a certain dose of intellectual humility (it’s hard to learn if you can’t admit that you might be wrong), a strong measure of conscientiousness (we want owners, not employees), comfort with ambiguity (we don’t know how our business will evolve, and navigating Google internally requires dealing with a lot of ambiguity), and evidence that you’ve taken some courageous or interesting paths in your life.”

### Selecting new candidates

Set a high bar for quality. Find your own candidates. Assess candidates objectively. Give candidates a reason to join.”

### Take power from your managers and trust your people to run things

“Make decisions based on data, not based on managers’ opinions”

“We use data—evidence—to guard against rumor, bias, and plain old wrongheadedness.” “People make all kinds of assumptions—guesses, really—about how things work in organizations. ”

“Pick an area where your people are frustrated, and let them fix it. If there are constraints, limited time or money, tell them what they are. Be transparent with your people and give them a voice in shaping your team or company.”

### OKR

If you set a crazy, ambitious goal and miss it, you’ll still achieve something remarkable”. “So at the beginning of each quarter, Larry sets OKRs for the company, triggering everyone else to make sure their own personal OKRs roughly sync with Google’s.

### Low performers

You are in the bottom 5 percent of performers across all of Google. I know that doesn’t feel good. The reason I’m telling you this is that I want to help you grow and get better. When they don’t, we first offer a range of training and coaching to help them build their capabilities. Note that this is very different from the typical approach of hiring people and then trying to train them into being stars. Our interventions here are for the small handful of people who struggle most, rather than for everyone. If that doesn’t work, we then help the person find another role within Google.

### Oxygen

Project Oxygen has had the most profound impact on Google. The name comes from a question Michelle once asked: “What if everyone at Google had an amazing manager? Not a fine one or a good one, but one that really understood them and made them. Having a good manager is essential, like breathing. And if we make managers better, it would be like a breath of fresh air. “The 8 Project Oxygen Attributes: Be a good coach. Empower the team and do not micromanage. Express interest/concern for team members’ success and personal well-being. Be very productive/results-oriented. Be a good communicator—listen and share information. Help the team with career development. Have a clear vision/strategy for the team. Have important technical skills that help advise the team.
